    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we shall learn how to use Google-provided Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In particular, we will be using [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) to search for locations and their details. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide uses Google APIs, but, in general, APIs provided by other providers have similar ways to utilise them, and they consist of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Identify APIs that we want to use.\n",
    "2. Check if we need special permissions/keys to utilise the APIs.\n",
    "3. Format API according to the instructions provided by the API provider.\n",
    "4. Make the API call using a HTTP client.\n",
    "5. Parse results and format them for consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 and 2 has already been done for you, so for this guide, we would start from **step 3**.\n",
