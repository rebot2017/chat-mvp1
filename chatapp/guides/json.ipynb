    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook would introduce you to Javascript Object Notation, or JSON, and how to work with them in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is an agreed-upon standard way to structure data. It is meant to be readable and writeable by humans, but in practice, we seldom hand-write JSON. JSON has its roots in Javascript, and nowadays, JSON is used primarily as a way to transmit data between servers and web application. Given its human-readable characteristics, web APIs also favour its usage as a means of encoding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is basically a set of formatting rules on how to represent data. At the most fundamental level, data is basically a set of attributes and value pairs. Take for example, a bank might have data on its customers. Customers would then have certain attributes:\n",
    ">customerID\n",
    "\n",
    ">Customer Name\n",
    "\n",
    ">Account Balance\n",
    "\n",
    ">Credit Rating\n",
    "\n",
    ">Amount Owed\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent Customer as a JSON:\n",
    ">```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"customerID\": \"C01234\",\n",
    "    \"Customer Name\": \"Average Joe\",\n",
    "    \"Account Balance\": 1234,\n",
    "    \"Credit Rating\": \"AAA\",\n",
    "    \"Amount Owed\": 456\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down a bit. The curly bracket, `{` and `}`, tells us that the data is an object. An object is nothing more than a bundle of attribute-value pairs. In this case, we have 5 pairs. And that's it. We have an object, a customer, with 5 attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are simply names given to the values, and values are the actual data. There are 2 types of data - string data and numbers \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to transmit *more* objects? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an array:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"customerID\": \"C05678\",\n",
    "        \"Customer Name\": \"Plain Jane\",\n",
    "        \"Account Balance\": 5678,\n",
    "        \"Credit Rating\": \"AAA\",\n",
    "        \"Amount Owed\": 789\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"customerID\": \"C05678\",\n",
    "        \"Customer Name\": \"Plain Jane\",\n",
    "        \"Account Balance\": 5678,\n",
    "        \"Credit Rating\": \"AAA\",\n",
    "        \"Amount Owed\": 789\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Notice the square brackets, `[` and `]`. They indicate that what's in between them, is an array, or a list of objects. We have 2 objects in our case, and they are separated by a comma, `,`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have learnt how to represent an object in JSON, and how to represent *many* of them in an array. But with what we have so far, we are still pretty limited in the kinds of data we can represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our *customer* example, what if we want to represent the different credit cards that the customer owns? \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON allows values"
